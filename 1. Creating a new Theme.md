All NopCommerce's theme are located in the Theme folder
```sh

You will find the **"DefaultClean"** theme.

* 3. Open the **Theme.config** file located in your new theme folder.
```sh
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>

	   supportRTL="true"
     previewImageUrl="~/Themes/HeTheme/preview.jpg"
     previewText="The Default theme for the Human Elevation Platform">
</Theme>
```
