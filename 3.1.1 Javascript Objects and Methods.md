A Guideline to built your own NopCommerce Themes

##Objects & Methods

Place a render section at the end of your layot. After the `@RenderBody()` helper.
```sh
@RenderSection("scripts", false)
```

NopCommerce Layouts are located at:

```sh
projectName/Views/Shared/_ColumnsOne.cshtml
projectName/Views/Shared/_ColumnsTwo.cshtml
projectName/Views/Shared/_ColumnsThree.cshtml
```


To access to properties within the application or call methods that relies on third party libraries such as Jquery, Chosen, etc...
you must use a `section helper`.

**Example 0.1**
```sh
@section scripts{
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
  alert('The page is ready!');
});
</script>
}
```

*Wrapping your script within the `@section helper` will place your scripts at the end you your body tag. After all the JS dependencies has been loaded *
