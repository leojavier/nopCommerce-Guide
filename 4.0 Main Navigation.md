A Guideline to built your own NopCommerce Themes

####Main navigation
The main Navigation or top menu is called from **_Root.cshtml**.

####File location
```sh
projectName\Presentation\Views\Catalog\TopMenu.cshtml
```

The original **TopMenu** is inefficient. It is rendering a duplicate of the menu to handle a responsive behavior. Here I'm including the new version using the bootstrap framework to handle mobile behaviors. Feel free to take it from the **Resource folder**
